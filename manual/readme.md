A Shell gathers input from a user and executes programs based on your input. When a program is finished executing, that programs output is displayed.

COMMANDS AND WHAT THEY DO

cd - change the current default directory.

clr - clear the screen.

dir - list the contents of directory.

environ - list all the environment strings.

echo - display on the display followed by a new line.

help - display the user manual.

pause - pause the shell until 'Enter' is pressed.

quit - quit the shell.

pwd - print working directory.

USAGE

To use the commands, simply type them into the command prompt and press 'Enter'.

SAMPLE USAGE

==> echo hello world
hello world

In Linux, you can make a command get its input from a file and then send its output to another file. Just so you know, this is known as input and output (I/O) redirection. If you want a command to receive instructions by reading from a file, you can redirect standard input to come from that file, rather than the keyboard. For example, cat < input.txt, in this command we redirected the contents of the input.txt file to the cat command. To save the output of a command in a file, redirect the standard output to a file. For example, input.txt > output.txt, in this command we redirected the contents of input.txt to output.txt.

Essentially, a process is a program in execution. Each time the shell executes a command you entered, it starts a process. The shell itself is a process, just like any scripts or programs run by the shell. Processes are identified and managed via a process identifier (pid).

A background process is a computer process that runs behind the scenes and does not require user interaction. Background processes can perform essential tasks that make other software programs run faster, or perform tasks that are necessary or useful and don't require the attention of the user. A foreground process is any command or task you run directly and wait for it to complete. Some foreground processes display a user interface that allows for ongoing interaction, while others execute a task and "freeze" the computer while it completes that task.
